Hello there!
I am currently a grad student at NYU Courant in the second year of my Master's in Computer Science. I have a keen interest in Machine Learning and Computer Vision. I am curently working in the lab of Prod. David Fouhey at NYU CDS. I did my undergrad at Ahmedabad University where I recieved a B.Tech Degree in CSE. While I wait for my model to converge, I also delve into anime, football(the european kind emoji) and continue my search for the best coffee shop in NYC.
